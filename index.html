        <h1 class="chapter-start">Ring Road</h1>
    
         <p>Massive glaciers visible from the highway, explosive geysers that only
          hint at the raw energy powering the entire country, and waterfalls so clean 
          you can drink out of their cascading waters, Iceland is a country unlike 
          any I’ve ever visited. It was the fall of 2018 when my siblings and I set out 
         along “Ring Road”, a lonesome highway that circumnavigates the entirety of the island. 
         Over the next two weeks we did our best to experience everything Iceland had
         to offer and we left wanting to explore even more.</p>

        <p>When we first arrived in Iceland, sunset was around 6:00 pm and every day it inched closer 
         and closer to 5:15 pm. So, it was with pink skies and long shadows that we made it to our first 
         stop: Thingvellir National Park, a world heritage site which contains the boundary between the 
         North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. It was in this rift valley that Icelandic parliament 
         met between the 10th to 16th centuries AD. The waterfall here was incredible to behold but we 
         would soon learn Iceland was lousy with breathtaking foss (Icelandic for falls) far grander than 
         this one.</p>

        <p>Strokkur is a geyser that erupts with regularity every 6 to 10 minutes. The 
         geothermal forces at work underneath this powerful eruption that can reach up 
         to 40 meters in height are present throughout Iceland. We found many towns along 
         Ring Road boasting gorgeous hot springs with temperatures that were absolutely
          perfect for lounging in.</p>

      <h1 class="chapter-start">Golden Falls</h1>
        <p>Arriving late was part of the plan when we visited Gullfoss (literally Golden 
        Falls). The twilight sun reflected on these waters made for spectacular colors 
        that seemed to light up the fine mist around the falls with gold dust. Unfortunately,
        I took a picture of a shadowed area for some reason. Nice.</p>

       <p>One evening, we arrived after dark to our hostel and were lulled to sleep by the sound of 
         a rush of water we couldn't see. When morning came, though, we saw a waterfall flowing 
         down a massive hill just behind our accommodations. It wasn’t a tourist attraction. It was 
        just one example of the many beautiful waterfalls that dotted the countryside. We decided to 
         explore it. Besides finding a spectacular view from the top, we were thrilled to discover 
         the water to be drinkable and delicious. Me, my brother, and my sister sat on that steep 
        slope for a long time just drinking from the waterfall and snacking on the bilberries that grew 
         wild all around our feet.</p>

       <h1 class="chapter-start">Land Of Ice</h1>
 
        <p>As we entered Southeast Iceland and its treasure trove of beautiful scenery, a giant glacier 
          was our companion along the highway. In Vatnajokull national park, a fork in the road separates 
          tourists going to visit a waterfall one way and tourists going to see the glacier another way. 
          Although we chose the waterfall, we misread the signs and ended up at the glacier. And we were 
         glad we did.</p>

      <h1 class="chapter-start">Entering Another World</h1>
        
        <p>While we drove through Ring Road enveloped in a fine fog, listening to the soundtrack of 
          ‘Blade Runner 2049’, we stumbled upon both Diamond Beach and Glacier Lagoon. Literally sitting 
          right next to the road, these popular tourist destinations were just begging us to stop. I had no 
         idea nature could produce such clear ice or such vivid blues.</p>

        <p>Fjords were a pleasure to drive through when we were at the bottom. More than a little 
         nerve-wracking while we skirted over and around them, though.</p>

      <h1 class="chapter-start">Cruising Amongst The Whales</h1>

        <p>One of the last things we did was go whale watching. Our cheaper boat tour was unexpectedly cancelled, 
          so they upgraded us to their premium tour on a quicker, more agile craft that let us get right up 
          to the whales.</p>

      <h1 class="chapter-start">A Fitting End</h1>
      
        <p>In the Westfjords of Iceland, the Dynjandi Waterfall (The Thunderer) is easily the most spectacular 
          site to visit. Incredibly, my siblings and I were among just a handful of people visiting this
          collection of seven cascades and the only ones that made it to the top waterfall -- a 329-foot 
          behemoth of a fall that resembles a tiered wedding cake. Just like with all other sites in Iceland, 
           we could get as close as we wanted to this natural wonder. And just like those other sites, we drank 
           the delicious water straight from the stream. A fitting end to our trip.</p>
